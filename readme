Simple rest rever supporting 
made with:
	restlet framework https://restlet.talend.com/
	json https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java
	jdbc driver for java https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/

---requirements
to be able to run program requried are:
	mariadb mysql server
		can be instaled through basic debian repository
			sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
		server needs to be runing
			service mysql start
	curl
		can be installed same way
			sudo apt-get install curl
	java
		can be installed same way or downloaded from oracle
			sudo apt-get install default-jdk
---setup
	for simplicity ther is only one script that needs to be run for setup
		./setup
	script compiles program, creates db and populates it, additionally reates new user that will be used to connect to it and perform tests
---running
	script ./run & starts server in the baskground , take note of pid for easy termination of this process with kill (pid), but if it falis kill %% works better
---testing
	script ./test_requests runs use case
	
also:
	i was a litte short on time so some things might not be as polished as possible, especially readability. I have additionally included docer file with setup environment, as i was using docker during development, all source files are in /home.
